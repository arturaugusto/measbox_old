Thank you for reading the terms of service!<br><br>

As you may know, Measbox is still beta. A lot can change, and many bugs can exist.<br><br>

You should also be aware, that the "snippets" data you input at Measbox will become accessible by all users. This is the main idea about information exchange proposed by the software.<br><br>

So, the disclaimer:<br><br>
